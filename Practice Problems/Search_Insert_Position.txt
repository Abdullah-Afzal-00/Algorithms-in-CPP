Problem : 

Search Insert Position O (Log n) | Binary Search
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is
found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
[1,3,5,6]
5
Output: 2
[1,3,5,6]
2
Output: 1
[1,3,5,6]
7
[1,3,5,6]
0


Solution:
    The solution of problem is the Binary Search as given as Hint with the problem statement.
    But here is a little variation to do for this problem in Binary Search. When the target value is not find then
    check whether the latest mid value of the array is smaller than the target value, if it is smaller then the 
    target value , then it will be after that index. 
    And if latest mid index value of array is not smaller than simply return the mid index as the target value will
    be placed at that index.
